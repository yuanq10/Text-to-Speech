# Text-to-Speech
Text to Mandarin speech using pyttsx3.

To use, download the full package. In the dist folder there is a wenben.txt file, put the text you want to convert to speech in this file. Then, Run the main.exe file in this folder to get the output.MP3 file. This output.MP3 file is the converted speech audio.

The .bat file specifies different parameter you can set upon starting the app, 1 is the normal default speed, 1.5 would increase to 1.5 times of normal, 0.5 would decrease to 0.5 times of normal speed. You could put any number here but its recommended to input within the range of 0.2 to 4.0
